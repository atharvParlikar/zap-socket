# Server Setup

## Installation

First, install the server package:

```bash
npm install @zap-socket/server
```

## Starting the WebSocket Server

```ts
import { createZapServer } from "@zap-socket/server";

const server = createZapServer({ port: 8080 }, () => {
  console.log("Server is running at: ws://localhost:8080/");
});
```

This sets up a basic zap-socket server. The event handlers are defined separately for cleaner organization.


## Defining Events

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { createZapServer, zapEvent } from "@zap-socket/server";

const events = {
  ping: zapEvent({
    process: () => "pong"
  }),

  playerPosition: zapEvent({
    input: z.object({
      playerId: z.string()
    }),
    process: ({ playerId }) => {
      // Fetch player position logic here
      return { x: 22, y: 24 };
    }
  }),
};

const server = createZapServer<typeof events>({ port: 8080, events }, () => {
  console.log("Server is running at: ws://localhost:8080/");
});
```

The `events` object is where you define all your WebSocket events. Each key represents an event name, and the value is a zap-socket primitive like `zapEvent` or `zapStream`.

### About `zapEvent`

`zapEvent` is a versatile building block. It supports both **request-response** style communication and **fire-and-forget** events (like emitting signals to clients). This duality allows you to keep your real-time logic concise and easy to manage.

### Registering Events

To register your events with the server, simply pass the `events` object to `createZapServer`. This enables the server to handle incoming messages based on the event definitions you've providedâ€”handling input validation, message routing, and type-safe responses automatically.

# Client Setup

## Installation

Install the client package:

```bash
npm install @zap-socket/client
```


## Connecting to the WebSocket Server

To connect to the server and send messages, use `createZapClient`:

```ts
import { createZapClient } from "@zap-socket/client";
import { Events } from "../server/index";

const url = "ws://localhost:8080/";
const client = createZapClient<Events>({ url });

client.onconnect = () => {
  run();
};

async function run() {
  // Send a message and wait for the server's response
  const response = await client.events.message.send("hi");
  console.log(response);

  // Fire-and-forget (no response expected)
  client.events.message.send("hii");
}
```

The client automatically reconnects if the connection is lost, and `onconnect` is called every time it successfully connects.


## Sending Events

Each event defined on the server is exposed as a method on `client.events`.

* Use `send(...)` to trigger a request-response interaction.
* You can also use `send(...)` without awaiting for fire-and-forget communication.
