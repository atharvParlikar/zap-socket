# Events

In `zap-socket`, an **event** is a named channel for communication between the client and server. Each message you send or receive is tagged with one of these event names.

For example:

1. `playerPosition` â€“ handles position update messages
2. `chatMessage` â€“ handles chat messages

> ðŸ’¡ Think of it like Socket.IO's "event names" â€” same idea, just with stronger typing.

Events are declared on the server in a simple object like this:

```ts
const events = {
  ping: zapEvent({
    process: () => "pong"
  }),
  playerPosition: zapEvent({
    input: z.string(),
    process: (playerId) => {
      return { x: 2, y: 2 };
    }
  })
}
```

## `zapEvent`

The `zapEvent()` function is the core primitive for defining events. It powers both standard listeners (fire-and-forget) and request-response patterns.

### Anatomy of `zapEvent`

Hereâ€™s a simplified version of its input type:

```ts
type ZapEventInput = {
  input?: T;
  middleware?: MiddlewareType[];
  process: (input: z.infer<T>, ctx: Context) => R;
  emitType?: E;
}
```

You define an event by passing an object with these fields:

* `input` *(optional)*: A [Zod](https://zod.dev) schema specifying the expected shape of the incoming message. If the message doesnâ€™t conform, itâ€™s rejected with a typed error.
* `middleware` *(optional)*: One or more middleware functions. See \[\[middleware]] for more.
* `process`: The main function that runs every time this event is triggered. Takes validated `input` and a \[\[context]] object.
* `emitType` *(optional)*: If your `process` function emits messages to clients, this defines the type of those outgoing messages for full type safety on the client.

### `process()` function

The `process` callback determines the behavior of the event â€” whether it behaves like a one-way listener or a request-response handler.

If `process()` returns a value, `zap-socket` automatically treats it as a request-response event, and replies to the client with the return value. The return type is inferred and enforced on the client.

**Parameters:**

* `input`: The incoming message payload (validated by `input`, if not provided process would fire without a input parameter)
* `ctx`: A context object passed with every event, containing useful metadata

```ts
type Context = {
  server: ServerInstance; // Reference to the server
  id: string;             // The sender's socket ID
  buffer: Record<string, any>; // Shared data across middleware and handlers
}
```

You can use `buffer` in `ctx` to store things like auth status, user metadata, database results â€” whatever your middleware attaches.
