# Middleware

Middleware in `zap-socket` works similarly to systems like tRPC. Each middleware function decides whether an incoming message should be processed. It also receives a `context` object you can populate and use later in the `process` step.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Middleware should **not** be used for input validation. Input is validated automatically via the `input` field in the `zapEvent` object.

---

## API

```ts
zapEvent({
  input: ...,         // Zod schema for validation
  middleware: [...],  // Array of middleware functions
  process: ...        // The main handler function
});
```

Middleware is just an array of functions. Each must return `true` (allow message) or `false` (block message). All must return `true` for the message to reach `process()`.

Supports both sync and async functions.

### Execution Flow

Middleware executes in order:

```txt
middleware[0] → ✅
middleware[1] → ✅
...
→ `process()` is called only if all pass.
```

---

## Example

```ts
const events = {
  privateAction: zapEvent({
    input: z.object({ data: z.string() }),
    middleware: [
      logger,
      auth,
      rateLimiter({ limit: 10, windowMs: 30000 }) // Factory — don't call it directly!
    ],
    process: ({ input }) => `Secure data: ${input.data}`
  })
};
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: You shouldn't authenticate every single incoming message, you only have to do it once as ws is stateful, the context buffer is persistant throughout the connection.

---

## Middleware Signature

```ts
type MiddlewareType = (
  ctx: MiddlewareContext,
  msg: MiddlewareMsg
) => boolean | Promise<boolean>;

type MiddlewareContext = Record<string, any>;

type MiddlewareMsg = {
  event: string;
  data: any;
  metadata: MiddlewareMetadata;
};

type MiddlewareMetadata = {
  id: string;
  ip: string;
  timestamp: number;
  size: number;
};
```

---

## Using Context

You can modify the `context` inside a middleware to pass data to the `process()` step:

```ts
const events = {
  someEvent: zapEvent({
    input: z.string(),
    middleware: [
      async (ctx, { metadata }) => {
        const { ip } = metadata;
        const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/getLocation?ip=${ip}`);
        const data = await res.json();

        ctx.location = data.location;
        return true;
      }
    ],
    process: ({ input }, ctx) => {
      console.log("User location:", ctx.location);
    }
  })
};
```

> 🧠 **Tip**: Think of `ctx` as a shared memory space that middleware and `process()` can both access.
