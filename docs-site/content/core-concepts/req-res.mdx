title: Request-Response Model in Zap Socket

# Request-Response Model

The request-response model in `zap-socket` works just like you'd expect. You send a request, you get a response, the only difference is that it's all happening over WebSockets instead of HTTP.

This makes it ideal for real-time applications where maintaining a persistent connection is beneficial.

## How It Works

To create a request-response event, use the `zapEvent` function. When your event's `process` handler returns something, the event automatically supports the request-response model.

### Example

#### Server

```ts
import { zapEvent } from '@zap-socket/server';
import { z } from 'zod';

const events = {
  someEvent: zapEvent({
    input: z.string(),
    process: (input) => {
      // Perform logic and return a response
      return "response from server";
    },
  }),
};
```

Because the `process` function returns a value, the `someEvent` becomes a request-response event automatically.

#### Client

```ts
import { createZapClient } from '@zap-socket/client';

const zap = createZapClient<typeof events>("ws://your-server-url");

const response = await zap.events.someEvent.send("your-input");

console.log(response); // "response from server"
```

No need to set up listeners. Just `await` the result and you're done.
